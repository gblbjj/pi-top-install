Setting up the pi-top speaker in pi-topOS and Raspbian Jessie

These instructions are for Raspbian Jessie and pi-topOS. If you are using Ubuntu Mate, see
https://github.com/luzhuomi/pi-top-speaker for installation.

The hardware installation instructions are inside the cover of the pi-top speaker package. You need to tear it open to see them
Set the switch to (m) for mono, (l) for left or (r) for right.

How does the speaker work
#########################

The speaker uses digital hdmi sound, which is provided on the SPDIF pin of the pi-top-hub-controller

Inside the speaker package, there is a DIR9001 transceiver, which converts the digital signal.
A TAS2505 amplifier amplifies this signal. This amplifier allows to adjust loudness using the i2c bus of the rpi.
Software needs to be installed on the rpi to route the sound to the hdmi channel and to send setup and loudness
commands to the amplifier. The i2c pins of the 40 pin connector of the rpi need to be connected to the corresponding
pins of the hub-controller, either using the 40 pin cable or some jumper cables.


Install the software
####################

Important: First, open a terminal and type
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install -y python-smbus wiringpi i2c-tools
	
This makes sure that these libraries are not accidentally removed in future upgrades.

The software package for pi-topSPEAKER is available on Raspbian without any modifications. The installation instructions that come with the pi-top speaker recommend the following two steps. These steps
are not required for versions of pi-topOS released after October 2016, but will not hurt.
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install -y pt-speaker

Reboot and then the pi-top speaker should be working.

Try out the sound using omxplayer as follows:
 omxplayer -o hdmi filename
 where filename is the name of the file to play.
 
The sound level can be adjusted using the + and - keys.
In gui video players like utube, sound levels can be adjusted with the system sound menu


If the speaker still does not work, do the following:
#####################################################

Look at the config file
#######################
Open a terminal and type

	sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Uncomment #hdmi_drive=2. ie remove the #
	  # Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
Uncomment #dtparam=audio=on 

Then save the file, (Ctrl x) and close the editor an reboot your system

If it still does not work, proceed as follows

Enable sound by modifying /etc/modules
######################################
Thanks to Trevor Baxter, who has suggested this solution.

Open a terminal and enter the followig:
   sudo nano /etc/modules
   
Add this line to the script, if it does not exist:
  snd_bcm2835
  
Save,exit and then reboot. You should now have working sound.

Test whether the Raspberry Pi can talk to the speaker using i2c:
################################################################

Reboot and check whether the speaker works. If not, proceed as follows:

Open a terminal and type
	i2cdetect -y 1
	
You should see your speaker at address 73, if you have set the switch to mono.
	
If i2cdetect still cannot find "/dev/i2c-1" your system is corrupted. pi-top recommends
to download a new image and start from scratch.

If you cannot see your speaker, check the 40 pin cable between the Raspberry Pi and the hub-controller,
or make sure that the i2c lines are connected using jumper cables.

If your speaker still does not work, it is time to get in contact with support@pi-top.com
