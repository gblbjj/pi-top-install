Setting up the pi-top speaker in pi-topOS and Raspbian Jessie
#############################################################

Original written by Norman Lawrence, additions by Rene Richarz

These instructions are for Raspbian Jessie and pi-topOS. If you are using Ubuntu Mate, see
https://github.com/luzhuomi/pi-top-speaker for installation.

The hardware installation instructions are inside the cover of the pi-top speaker package. You need to tear it open to see them
Set the switch to (m) for mono, (l) for left or (r) for right.

How does the speaker work
#########################

The speaker uses digital hdmi sound, which is provided on the SPDIF pin of the pi-top-hub-controller

Inside the speaker package, there is a DIR9001 transceiver, which converts the digital signal.
A TAS2505 amplifier amplifies this signal. This amplifier allows to adjust loudness using the i2c bus of the rpi.
Software needs to be installed on the rpi to route the sound to the hdmi channel and to send setup and loudness
commands to the amplifier. The i2c pins of the 40 pin connector of the rpi need to be connected to the corresponding
pins of the hub-controller, either using the 40 pin cable or some jumper cables.


Install the software
####################

Important: First, open a terminal and type
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install -y python-smbus wiringpi i2c-tools
	
This makes sure that these libraries are not accidentally removed in future upgrades.

The installation instructions that come with the pi-top speaker recommend the following two steps. These steps
should not be required anymore in the October 2016 version of pi-topOS, but will not hurt.
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install -y pt-speaker
	
This works well with pi-topOS and you should have working sound. If you are using Raspbian Jessie then you will
almost certainly be greated with the response:
	"Unable to locate package pt-speaker"

Second step for Raspbian Jessie users, which worked for me with my Pi3 and a number of other people who posted
to this forum. [Thanks to John.newman80 who provided a link to the following website

http://www.rs-online.com/designspark/electronics/eng/blog/lorawan-enabling-the-pi-top ].
Do visit the website as the following instructions have been drawn from there.  

Navigate to /etc/apt/sources.list.d, by typing
 
	cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d

make a new file named pi-top.list:
	sudo nano pi-top.list
or if you prefer the desktop editor:
    sudo leafpad pi-top.list

add the following line:

	deb http://apt.pi-top.com/raspbian/ jessie main

save the file and close the editor.

Navigate to your home directory and get the required public key:

	cd
 	wget http://apt.pi-top.com/apt.pi-top.com.gpg.key

Add the key to the APT keyring, then remove it from your home directory

 	sudo apt-key add apt.pi-top.com.gpg.key
 	rm apt.pi-top.com.gpg.key

Ensure the Pi is up to date:

 	sudo apt-get update

 	sudo apt-get upgrade

Install the pi-top specific package pt-speaker

	sudo apt-get install -y pt-speaker
	
Reboot and then the pi-top speaker should be working.

Try out the sound using omxplayer as follows:
 omxplayer -o hdmi filename
 where filename is the name of the file to play.
 
The sound level can be adjusted using the + and - keys.
In gui video players like utube, sound levels can be adjusted with the system sound menu


If the speaker still does not work, do the following:
#####################################################

Look at the config file
#######################
Open a terminal and type

	sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Uncomment #hdmi_drive=2. ie remove the #
	  # Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
Uncomment #dtparam=audio=on 

Then save the file, (Ctrl x) and close the editor an reboot your system

If it still does not work, proceed as follows

Enable sound by modifying /etc/modules
######################################
Thanks to Trevor Baxter, who has suggested this solution.

Open a terminal and enter the followig:
   sudo nano /etc/modules
   
Add this line to the script, if it does not exist:
  snd_bcm2835
  
Save,exit and then reboot. You should now have working sound.

Test whether the Raspberry Pi can talk to the speaker using i2c:
################################################################

Open a terminal and type
    sudo apt-get install -y python-smbus wiringpi i2c-tools
    
Reboot and check whether the speaker works. If not, proceed as follows:

Open a terminal and type
	i2cdetect -y 1
	
You should see your speaker at address 73, if you have set the switch to mono.
	
If i2cdetect reports that it cannot find "/dev/i2c-1" you need to switch i2c on in
Menu->Preferences->Raspberry Pi Configuration -> Interfaces

If i2cdetect still cannot find "/dev/i2c-1" your system is corrupted. pi-top recommends
to download a new image and start from scratch.

If you cannot see your speaker, check the 40 pin cable between the Raspberry Pi and the hub-controller,
or make sure that the i2c lines are connected using jumper cables.

If your speaker still does not work, it is time to get in contact with support@pi-top.com

Workaround for a bug in the current version of gpio
###################################################

Open a terminal and type
    pt-speaker

If you get an error message
    gpio: Unable to find i2cdetect command
this is due to a bug in the recent version of gpio.

If this is the case, type
    sudo nano /usr/bin/pt-speaker
or
    sudo leafpad /usr/bin/pt-speaker

Navigate to line 93 (in leafpad you can turn on line numbers under options) and
replace "gpio i2cdetect" with "i2cdetect -y 1". Save and reboot.

Thanks to Nathan, who has suggested this workaround for the rpi 2 and 3.

Upgrading to PIXEL desktop
##########################

If you upgrade your Raspbian Jessie to the new PIXEL desktop using "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade", your speaker
will stop working, because the file /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart gets overwritten. You need to
manually add the line "@pt-speaker" to this file after upgrading.

If it still does not work after a reboot, do a
	sudo apt-get install -y python-smbus wiringpi i2c-tools
and reboot.
